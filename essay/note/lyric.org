** rolling in the deep(adele)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out
and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
and it's bring me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you,
and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there,
reminds you of the home we shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it
With the beat

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all it all,
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it
To the beat

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it,played it, played it,played it
To the beat

** with or without you(U2)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you

hey jude, don't make it bad.
take a sad song and make it better.
remember to let her into your heart,
then you can start to make it better.
hey jude, don't be afraid.
you were made to go out and get her.
the minute you let her under your skin,
then you begin to make it better.
and anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain,
don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
for well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
by making his world a little colder.
hey jude, don't let me down.
you have found her, now go and get her.
remember to let her into your heart,
then you can start to make it better.
so let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin,
you're waiting for someone to perform with.
and don't you know that it's just you, hey jude, you'll do,

love, love is a verb
love is a doing word
feathers on my breath
gentle impulsion
shakes me makes me lighter

teardrop on the fire

teardrop on the fire of a confession

** Eternal Flame
http://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/eternal-flame.html

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I was taught assembler
in my second year of school.
It's kinda like construction work —
with a toothpick for a tool.
So when I made my senior year,
I threw my code away,
And learned the way to program
that I still prefer today.

Now, some folks on the Internet
put their faith in C++.
They swear that it's so powerful,
it's what God used for us.
And maybe it lets mortals dredge
their objects from the C.
But I think that explains
why only God can make a tree.

For God wrote in Lisp code
When he filled the leaves with green.
The fractal flowers and recursive roots:
The most lovely hack I've seen.
And when I ponder snowflakes,
never finding two the same,
I know God likes a language
with its own four-letter name.

Now, I've used a SUN under Unix,
so I've seen what C can hold.
I've surfed for Perls, found what Fortran's for,
Got that Java stuff down cold.
Though the chance that I'd write COBOL code
is a SNOBOL's chance in Hell.
And I basically hate hieroglyphs,
so I won't use APL.

Now, God must know all these languages,
and a few I haven't named.
But the Lord made sure, when each sparrow falls,
that its flesh will be reclaimed.
And the Lord could not count grains of sand
with a 32-bit word.
Who knows where we would go to
if Lisp weren't what he preferred?

And God wrote in Lisp code
Every creature great and small.
Don't search the disk drive for man.c,
When the listing's on the wall.
And when I watch the lightning burn
Unbelievers to a crisp,
I know God had six days to work,
So he wrote it all in Lisp.

Yes, God had a deadline.
So he wrote it all in Lisp.

** in my remains(linkin park)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Separate, sifting through the wreckage, 
I can't concentrate.
Searching for the message in the fear and pain.
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive.
Now in my remains, our promises, 
they never came
So let silence ring to wash away the worst of me.
Come apart, 
falling in the cracks of every broken heart.
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting 
for the chance to feel alive.
Now in my remains, 
our promises, they never came
So let silence ring to 
wash away the worst of me.

Like an army falling, one by one by one.
Like an army falling, one by one by one.
Like an army falling, one by one by one.
Like an army falling, one by one by one.
Now in my remains, 
our promises, they never came
So let silence ring to wash away the worst of me.
Like an army falling, one by one by one.
Like an army falling, one by one by one.

** wake me up when september ends(Green Day)

Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass, seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again, like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

Here comes the rain again, falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again, becoming who we are
As my memory rests, but never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass, twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends

** 私奔（郑钧）
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
把青春献给身后那座
辉煌的都市
为了这个美梦
我们付出着代价
把爱情留给我身边
最真心的姑娘
你陪我歌唱
你陪我流浪
陪我两败俱伤
一直到现在
才突然明白
我梦寐以求
是真爱和自由
想带上你私奔
奔向最遥远城镇
想带上你私奔
去做最幸福的人
 
在熟悉的异乡
我将自己一年年流放
穿过鲜花
走过荆棘
只为自由之地
在欲望的城市
你就是我最后的信仰
洁白如一道喜乐的光芒
将我心照亮
不要再悲伤
我看到了希望
你是否还有勇气
随着我离去
想带上你私奔
奔向最遥远城镇
想带上你私奔
去做最幸福的人
 
不要再悲伤
我看到了希望
你是否还有勇气
随着我离去
想带上你私奔
奔向最遥远城镇
想带上你私奔
去做最幸福的人
带上你私奔
带上你私奔

** 红旗下的蛋（崔健）
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
突然的开放　实际并不突然
现在机会到了　可能知道该干什么
红旗还在飘扬　没有固定方向
革命还在继续　老头儿更有力量
钱在空中飘荡　我们没有理想
虽然空气新鲜　可看不见更远地方
虽然机会到了　可胆量还是太小
我们的个性都是圆的
象红旗下的蛋
 
象红旗下的蛋
 
头突然出来　是多年的期待
挺胸抬头叫喊　是天生的遗传
心里当然明白　我们是谁的后代
无论行为好坏　内心还是清白
权力在空中飘荡　经常打在肩上
突然一个念头　不再跟着别人乱走
虽然身体还软　虽然只会叫喊
看那八九点钟的太阳
象红旗下的蛋
 
象红旗下的蛋
 
肚子已经吃饱了　脑子已经想开了
别说这是恩情　永远报答不尽
我们不再是棋子儿　走着别人划的印儿
自己想试着站一站　走起来四处看看
现实象个石头　精神象个蛋
石头虽然坚硬　可蛋才是生命
妈妈仍然活着　爸爸是个旗杆子
若问我们是什么　红旗下的蛋
 
象红旗下的蛋
 
象红旗下的蛋

** 假行僧（崔健）
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
我要从南走到北
我还要从白走到黑
我要人们都看到我
但不知我是谁
假如你看我有点累
就请你给我倒碗水
假如你已经爱上我
就请你吻我嘴
 
我有这双脚 我有这双腿
我有这千山和万水
我要这所有的所有
但不要恨和悔
要爱上我你就别怕后悔
因有一天我要远走高飞
我不想留在一个地方
也不愿有人跟随
我要从南走到北
我还要从白走到黑
我要人们都看到我
但不知道我是谁
 
我只想看你长得美
但不想知道你在受罪
我想要得到天上的水
但不是你的泪
我不愿相信真的有魔鬼
也不愿与任何人作对
你别想知道我到底是谁
也别想看到我的虚伪

生命就像 一条大河
时而宁静 时而疯狂
现实就像 一把枷锁

我要飞得更高

翅膀卷起风暴
心生呼啸

一直在飞 一直在找
可我发现 无法找到
若真想要 是一次解放
要先剪碎 这有过的往
我要的一种生命更灿烂
我要的一片天空更蔚蓝

多少次幸福却心如刀绞
多少次灿烂却失魂落魄
谁知道我们该梦归何处

** 21 Guns（Green Day）
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating
 
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside
You're in ruins
 
One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
 
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And you're throughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins
 
One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
 
Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
 
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something side this heart has died
You're in ruins
 
One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, 21 guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
